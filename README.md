# Arthur W. de Waal—Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my data science portfolio. Here I catologue projects undertaken during spare time. Five projects are intended, noting that new projects are regularly catologued soonest after completion. To that effect, please return soon for an updated. 

Projects are coded in either R or Python—R projects are created in RStudio while python projects are created in Jupyter Notebooks. The following projects are catologued thus far:

Project 1 - Factor Analysis of the Basic Human Values Scale [Status - Complete]. 

Project 2 - Data Analysis of Signage Survey [Status - Working Project].

Project 3 - Data Analysis of Spotify Listening History [Pending].
