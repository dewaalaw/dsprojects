# Arthur W. de Waalâ€”Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my data science portfolio. Here I catologue projects undertaken during spare time. Five projects are intended, noting that new projects are regularly catologued soonest after completion. To that effect, please check back in a short while for an update. 

On a general note, projects are coded in either R or Python. R projects were created in RStudio while python projects were created in Jupyter Notebooks. The following projects are catologued thus far:

Project 1 - Factor Analysis of the Basic Human Values scale. 

Project 2 - Data Analysis of Signage Survey.

Project 3 - Data Analysis of Spotify Listening History.
