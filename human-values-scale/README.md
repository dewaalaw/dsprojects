## About the Human Values Scale

The basic human value scale is a 21-item scale developed by Shalom H. Schwartz that measures 10 basic human values to identify respondents according to their basic value orientation. The human values model posits a circular structure where adjacent values are more compatible than those further away, and those at opposite ends are likely at conflict (Schwartz, 1994). While all people recognise the 10 values, their hierarchical arrangement each differs, the extend where opinions and behaviours are influenced the values higher up in the hierarchy.

## Data

The data was obtained for Sweden from the European Social Survey (ESS), rounds 1 through 8. After removing missing and un-related values, the data contained 1441 respondents each which evaluated the 21 indicators on a 6-point Likert scale.

## Objectives

Firstly, the indicators were examined to determine whether the human value scale measures what it is out to measure (see part 1). The following objective was the underlying structure of the data to determine the data's dimensionality or the factors, i.e., whether there are sets of variable that are highly intercorrelated. Hence, rather than a Q factor analysis, an R factor analysis was commisioed to determine dimensions Ior constructs) latent within the data. To that end, the data was summarised rather than reduced, noting that these are the two outcomes provisioned by factor analysis (see part 2). The last objective validates the factor analysis by way of a confirmatory factor analysis through structural equation modelling—whether the data explains the posited theoretic model.

## Approach

-   Psychometric Analysis (Part 1)
-   Exploratory Factor Analysis (Part 2)
-   Confirmatory Factor Analysis (Part 3)

## Evaluation and Conclusion

Psychometric Analysis: The Test information function plateaus at 5.1, for the range $(0<= \theta<=1)$. Hence the human values scale provide accurate information of examinees' ability within the said range—outside of which precision decreases.

Exploratory Factor Analysis: The analysis obtains an optimal structure revealing four latent factors.

Confirmatory Factor Analysis: The model fit measures suggest inadequate model fit.
