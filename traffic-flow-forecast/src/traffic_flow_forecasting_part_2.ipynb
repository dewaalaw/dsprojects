An LSTM uses past information with new information to predict output. It resolves a conventional RNN's short-term memory loss caused by a vanishing gradient. Small gradients bring about insignificant to no changes in the weight, resulting in weights un-updated that terminates network learning. (As as aside, weights are assigned to each feature to mark their contribution in predicting the target.)"],"metadata":{"id":"2jAtaoCOnVHC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Development Environment"],"metadata":{"id":"0sWkpBcgyn4U"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import datetime\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","from tensorflow.keras import Model, Sequential\n","\n","from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam\n","from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping\n","from tensorflow.keras.losses import MeanSquaredError\n","from tensorflow.keras.metrics import MeanAbsoluteError\n","\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Conv1D, LSTM, Lambda, Reshape, RNN, LSTMCell\n","\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"],"metadata":{"id":"pbfVc0kNxivz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1664094887730,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2582,"user":{"displayName":"Hrund","userId":"04532098259988856837"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/gdrive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"CsmRiTXWyznX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1664095439813,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":106036,"user":{"displayName":"Hrund","userId":"04532098259988856837"}},"outputId":"f71cf832-7e10-4944-ed49-0c69c7b88aef"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /gdrive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["train_df = pd.read_csv('/gdrive/MyDrive/TrafficFlowData/metro_interstate_traffic_volume_train.csv')\n","val_df = pd.read_csv('/gdrive/MyDrive/TrafficFlowData/metro_interstate_traffic_volume_validate.csv')\n","test_df = pd.read_csv('/gdrive/MyDrive/TrafficFlowData/metro_interstate_traffic_volume_test.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"0blrNou8x_4r","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1664095445040,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":716,"user":{"displayName":"Hrund","userId":"04532098259988856837"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class DataWindow():\n","  # Initialise a DataWindow object\n","  def __init__(self, input_width, label_width, shift, train_df=train_df, \n","             val_df=val_df, test_df=test_df, label_columns=None):\n","    self.train_df = train_df\n","    self.val_df = val_df\n","    self.test_df = test_df\n","    \n","    # Name of column to predict\n","    self.label_columns = label_columns\n","    if label_columns is not None:\n","      # Dict. of name and index of label column.
