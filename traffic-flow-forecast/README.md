## About
Implementation of models based on the architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network; a Recursive Neural Network by way of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Architecture; as well as an Auto-Regressive LSTM to predict traffic volume for a single- and 24 hour time-step. Additionally, a multi-output model that predicts temperature and traffic volume is created.

## Data
Hourly traffic counts, in the westboud direction, on the I-94 highway, interconnecting Minneapolis and St.Paul, Minnesota, from 2012 to 2018.

## Objectives
- Predict hourly traffic volume and temperature.
- Develop a rigourous testing protocol to compare predictive capacity of model architecture.
